I have a couple of older bikes that I&#39;m not using anymore, if anyone wants either of these bikes, they are free for the taking. Bike #1 on the left is a Raleigh Racer and Bike #2 on the right is a Free Spirit. These bikes are both a bit on the heavy side and some tuning would help, but you can ride them around town just as they are, no problems.</p>
<p><strong> Update: Both bikes have been claimed :( </strong></p>

  <img alt="Freespirit profile" src="/media/posts/free-bikes/freespirit-bike-profile.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Note: They currently reside in Manchester, NH and will not fit in my car. So either you would have to pick up, ride out, or wait till I get a bike rack.</p>
