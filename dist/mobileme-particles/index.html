There is a lot to love on this page and an unbelievable attention to detail.</p>
<p>Inspired by the login page and a wanting to tinker with canvas and particles I set out to recreate the wispy particle effect. You can see the progress I made at the following page: <a href="http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/mobileme-particles/">mobileme-particles</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m happy with how it turned out but there are a few things that could be improved. For one, the movement in the original is less rigid with more twists and turns. Is a flocking algorithm being used? Also, the mouse interaction with the particles in the original is livelier and has a nice bounce back effect when the mouse moves away from the particles.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d like to look at or use the code you can grab it on <a href="https://github.com/lokesh/mobileme-particles">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>There are quite a few places on the web to learn about simple particle systems. If you want to go a little further and add forces, I found the following two posts useful:</p>
