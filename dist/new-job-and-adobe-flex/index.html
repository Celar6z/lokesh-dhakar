      <p>Things have been quiet on the blog front but lots has been happening on other fronts. I can catch you up in about three paragraphs. Here goes.</p>
<p>I switched jobs! I left my job as Web Developer at <a href="http://www.3000k.com">3000k</a>, a small web shop in Worcester, about three weeks ago to join <a href="http://www.meridiascapital.com">Meridias Capital</a>. The Meridias Capital public site is a bit sparse so let me fill you in. The company is a mortgage finance lender centered out of Las Vegas with a secondary office in Salt Lake City. They have a couple of enterprise-level web apps that help faciliatate the mortgage finance process internally. This is where I come in.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be working out of Boston with Michael Lowry, Director of <acronym title="User Interface">UI</acronym>, to architect, design, and build the UI for these apps. I was hired for my traditional front-end skills: XHTML, XML, CSS, JS, etc. but soon after my arrival there was a strong push to investigate <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Adobe Flex</a>. After some research and prototyping we came to the conclusion that Adobe Flex was a better solution for our <acronym title="Rich Internet Application">RIA</acronym> then a traditional HTML/AJAX approach. So we have cast off into a brave new world!</p>
<p>Note: We will be looking at add another member to our small Boston UI team shortly. If you have Flex experience or experience developing web apps with Flash, drop me a note. We will post proper details on the opening shortly.</p>
