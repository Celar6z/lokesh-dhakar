<h2 id="a-fan-s-guide-to-identifying-pitches-">A fan&#39;s guide to identifying pitches.</h2>
<p>I&#39;m a baseball fan. I&#39;ve watched my share of televised games and attended a few handful. After all this, I was still in the dark about the difference between pitches. I knew a curveball broke downwards, but what exactly was a circle changeup?</p>
<p>The diagrams below are the results of skimming through baseball books and doing online research. This is not a complete guide. I&#39;ve picked twelve of the more common pitches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastballs</strong>: Four-seam, Two-seam, Cutter, Splitter, and Forkball</li>
<li><strong>Breaking Balls</strong>: Curveball, Slider, Slurve, and Screwball</li>
<li><strong>Changeups</strong>: Changeup, Palmball, Circle Changeup</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learning-to-identify-pitches">Learning to identify pitches</h3>
<p>The list of pitches might seem like a lot to keep track of, but remember that each pitcher utilizes only a selection of these pitches. For example, Pedro Martinez throws a curveball, circle-changeup, an occasional slider, and a fastball. Do a little research on the pitcher before the game.</p>
<p>Things to watch for that will help you identify a pitch:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Movement</strong> - the general direction the ball is moving</li>
<li><strong>Break</strong> - a sudden shift in direction</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few other things that can help you identify a pitch: ball rotation, point of release, and grip. For a casual fan though, it might be a bit much and I don&#39;t illustrate or discuss any of the latter three items.</p>
<h3 id="reading-the-diagrams">Reading the diagrams</h3>
<p>Take note of the speed, movement, and break of the ball. Don&#39;t worry about where the baseball is shown in the the strike zone. You can throw a fastball in the middle of the strike-zone like the one illustrated, or you can throw one high and away from the batter. It&#39;s still a fastball. Location doesn&#39;t determine the pitch.</p>
