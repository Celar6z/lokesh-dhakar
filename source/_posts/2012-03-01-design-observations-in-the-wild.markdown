      Gas Tank Direction Icon

    <p>
      I recently learned that the gas pump icon near your car's fuel gauge has an arrow indicating which side the gas tank is on.

      I'm not sure if this is meant to tap our unconscious or to provide a script to small kids on exactly what to say to pester their parents.

      Which menu option is currently selected, 'Yes' or 'No'? I'm not sure either. I sometimes get the same feeling when an <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tlJtc9JqLds/TT03q4zlbCI/AAAAAAAAADM/oE5Qj3Uh-Xw/s1600/alert.png" target="_blank">OSX dialog</a> pops up.

      Irving Gas Station - Bottle Ratings

    <p>
      Notice the use of one, two, and three bottles over the fuel grades. They are subtly implying that 'clean supreme' is three times as good as 'clean regular'. Three times is more impressive than the 7% better octane rating 'clean supreme' has over 'clean regular'.

    <p>
      I found this bar chart in an old issue of The Economist. A quick scan of this graph would give you an impression that foreclosures are skyrocketing. Look at the date ranges on the x-axis to see the absurdity.
