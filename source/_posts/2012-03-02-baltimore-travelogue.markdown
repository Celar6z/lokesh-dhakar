## Places that are memorable for one reason or another.

It was made this year, though it collects a few places I've visited on trips to Baltimore in the past three years. *It's a log*: a list of places I want to remember and maybe revisit. *And a map*: showing me where things are relative to each other. Its not for driving directions. There is a 'to-do' list in the left column, which I've discontinued using.

It's big and I can hang it on my wall, which I can't to do with a Google Map or Yelp. See it on [flickr][1] and direct link to [full-size image][2] (1 MB)
