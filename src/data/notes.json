All of these are now visual touchstones that every modern sci-fi film taps. The impact of Blade Runner on sci-fi imagery, especially cyberpunk, cannot be overstated. And the movie still looks great 30+ years later.</p>\n<p><em>What does it mean to be human?</em> This is the overarching question in the movie. It plays out between humans and replicants. Replicants are &#39;robots&#39; created by humans that are virtually identical to humans, but treated as property. Through out the movie, it&#39;s not clear if Deckard, Harrison Ford&#39;s character, is a replicant or not. This is an interesting way to point out that the answer to the question of Deckard&#39;s humanity doesn&#39;t matter. If as viewers, we can&#39;t tell if he is a replicant or not, does it matter if he is or not?</p>\n",

      "contents": "<p>The classic Gen-X indie film from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Linklater\">Richard Linklater</a>.</p>\n<p>The movie has no main character. Instead, it has a meandering camera that uses long takes to move between characters and stories, mostly unrelated. It&#39;s a movie about conversations and small moments, and not about plot. The unconventional structure is refreshing.</p>\n<p>The people, the conversations, everything, it all felt familiar. I lived in this world in the early 2000s in Boston, even though this movie takes place in Austin at the start of the 90s.</p>\n<p>Though the term <em>slacker</em> has negative connotations now, Linklater thought of slackers in positive terms. Something akin to a hippie or a beatnik. <i>These are people who intentionally disconnect from mainstream society, not because they are apathetic or unmotivated, but because society isn&#39;t helping them, and they don&#39;t see what it offers.</i></p>\n<p><em>&quot;Slacker is inspiration to keep on with those passion projects—to go your own way despite the pressure to conform. Above all, the film taught me this: Those who wander may not be lost.&quot; - Eleanor Capaldi</em></p>\n<p>Recommended for those who say &quot;film&quot; rather than &quot;movie&quot;.

Mostly.</p>\n<p><em>Snow Crash</em> was my intro into the cyberpunk genre and it&#39;s on the very short list of books I&#39;ve read more than twice. I love the world building; the sovereign zones run by big business franchises, the self-policing gated community &#39;burbclaves&#39;, the Second World-esque metaverse, and so much more. The set pieces are also fast-paced and a fun ride, especially the intially pizza delivery.</p>\n<p>But there are a few things that don&#39;t hold up as well. Neal Stephenson does this thing where he info dumps on a topic, and these excursions span many, many pages. In this case, we get an education on Sumerian myths and language. The problem is that these segments break up the flow of the story and cause a huge tonal shift. I found these sections tedius. Another issue with he book is the character YT&#39;s age, 15. It&#39;s problematic in many scenes.</p>\n<p>Overall, I did enjoy the book on this revisit. I&#39;d like to read other Stephenson books that take place in this or a similar world.</p>\n",

The story of Jugris Rudkus and his Lithuanian family who have recently immigrated to Chicago. They arrive with optimism and a drive to better their lives, but all this hope gets wittled away. As immigrants, they are a target for exploitation. And the work available to them in this newly industrialized city is harsh and unsafe. The first half of the book focuses on the trials of the family. The writing is simple and effective, and what they go through is harrowing.</p>\n<p>The latter half half of the book slumps a bit as we follow Jugris&#39;s solo adventures and finish with a somewhat dated speech on socialism.

The show has serious issues. The directors, who sound like they originally had good intentions to raise awareness about big cat captivity issues, lost their way. They plotted and edited their way into trashy tv to get ratings. They had a great opportunity, and a captive audience, but sadly, more people are discussing Joe Exotic and trolling Carole Bakin, instead of considering the welfare of the animals. Joe Exotic has become a folk hero and most viewers have a distorted view of the situation.</p>\n",
