Two cultures looking at the same thing, but seeing things very differently.</p>\n<p>The story is told through a set of conversations between the author, Ken Nerburn, and a Lakota elder, named Dan. The stripped down format is a perfect vessel to capture Dan&#39;s thoughts on topics, which are eloquently stated and deeply personal.</p>\n",

The movie has aged amazingly well over 60 years and the issues of generational differences and familial relationships it tackles are still present.\nThis goes straight into my favorite movies of all-time list! Which is rare from a first viewing.</p>\n",
