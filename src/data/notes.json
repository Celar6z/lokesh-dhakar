All of these are now visual touchstones that every modern sci-fi film taps. The impact of Blade Runner on sci-fi imagery, especially cyberpunk, cannot be overstated. And the movie still looks great 30+ years later.</p>\n<p><em>What does it mean to be human?</em> This is the overarching question in the movie. It plays out between humans and replicants. Replicants are &#39;robots&#39; created by humans that are virtually identical to humans, but treated as property. Through out the movie, it&#39;s not clear if Deckard, Harrison Ford&#39;s character, is a replicant or not. This is an interesting way to point out that the answer to the question of Deckard&#39;s humanity doesn&#39;t matter. If as viewers, we can&#39;t tell if he is a replicant or not, does it matter if he is or not?</p>\n",
