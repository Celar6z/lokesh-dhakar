This book is worth reading, not simply because it shows how the unjust treatment and loss of culture that Native Americans suffered percolates down in to their modern day life, but because it gets you to see the same world from two sets of eyes. Two cultures looking at the same thing, but seeing things very differently.

The story is told through a set of conversations between the author, Ken Nerburn, and a Lakota elder, named Dan. The stripped down format is a perfect vessel to capture Dan's thoughts on topics, which are eloquently stated and deeply personal.
