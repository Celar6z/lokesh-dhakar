This is a story of Patti Smith's relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, her muse, her part-time partner, and her fellow artist. I came into this book expecting a history of  her music career and the nascent punk scene, and this isn't that. The focus is on Patti and Robert. It's about their life-long relationship, and how they support each other and their art, and how the art, in the end – is less important than the relationship they form.

The book takes place in New York City in the late 60s and early 70s, and Patti eventually is in the thick of the scene. She runs in to Andy Warhol, William S Burroughs, John Cale, et al and spends time at The Chelsea Hotel, Max's Kansas City, and CBGB. Though not the main focus of the book, you'll witness the the art and punk scene develop in the periphery.

<!--
Patti's writing is lucid and simple. This is the different from a recent read, _The Goldfinch_, in which Donna Tartt's uses a literary style – long winding sentences and florid descriptions. Both manage to tell their stories without their word and grammar choices becoming distractions, though I am still in awe of Tartt's mastery of the craft.
