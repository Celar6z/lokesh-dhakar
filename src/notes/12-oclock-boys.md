When I used to live in Baltimore I would see the dirt bike riders meeting up in Druid Hill Park. This documentary gives some basic backstory on who they are and how they got into the scene, but the focus of the movie is on one young kid, Pug, and his family.

It seems like Pug's story, and his onscreen charima, enamored the director and they reshaped the documentary into one that focuses on him. His story is one of challenges growing up in impoverished conditions in the inner-city, and we get a surface level view of it, but I think there was an opportunity to go deeper here. Though the crew was mostly stand-offish, I wish there was more quiet time between them and the subjects where they they were able to get them to open up. In the end, the documentary paints an unflattering picture of the family, and I'm not sure it's completely fair.

As for the dirt bike riding, I'm into it. Minus the overly risky behavior like runnind reds at full speed and antagonizing the police, the rest is just an outlet that gives them a sense of freedom and joy. In a way, it reminds me of the fixed gear bike scene.
