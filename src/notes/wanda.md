I discovered this indie movie from [Amy Seimetz's Top 10 list](https://www.criterion.com/current/top-10-lists/376-amy-seimetz-s-top-10) hosted at Criterion.com and went into it blind, and I was blown away. It's bleak, realistic, well-acted, and infinitely fascinating.

The character of Wanda is sometimes frustrating, but always mesmorizing. She's sweet, naive, and drifts through the film like a ghost. Barbara Holden, also the director, plays the role so naturally. It's a unique, flawed character, and like none I've seen before on film.
