I was coming into this with high expectations after hearing about this movie from a couple of different sources in the same week, and the praise was steep, with critics exclaiming it was "one of the greatest Indian films of all-time".

So did it live up to the hype? First off, it's a beautifully shot movie, and hard to believe this was the debut for both the director and the cinematographer. It's shot in black and white and was recently restored to pristine condition by the Criterion Collection.

The movie is the first of three in the _Apu Trilogy_. In this one, we see Apu as a young child living in poor conditions in rural Bengal. Though Apu is the title character of the triology, in this one he plays a minor role, with the movie focusing on the women in his life, his mother and sister.

Back to the original question. No, it didn't live up to the hype for me. The slice-of-life approach felt slow and I wasn't vested enough into the characters ahead of the last third of the movie where the key events of the movie take place. A big part of this disconnect was likely due to the fact that I watched half of the movie on a flight and finished the other half a couple weeks later. That's really the biggest lesson from this, I need to watch movies in single sittings! I plan to revisit this again in the future.
