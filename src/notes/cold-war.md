This love-conquers-all tale coming from Poland was not on my radar, but I happened across it by chance on a trip to LA.

The movie is stunning. It is filmed in black and white, beautifully framed, lit, and art directed ([Clip: In the field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI4IOkjPrcQ)). The camera tends to pan and dolly slowly, and only as much as is required, but there are a couple of more frenetic scenes where we get to see the director and crew show off with some amazing choreography between the subjects and the camera ([[Clip: Dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCuEXWMh5Vo)).

I don't talk about the characters, plot, or themes here. But I want to note that the movie doesn't miss the mark in any of these categories. It's an engaging story, composed together in a light-weight, but interesting way. I plan on rewatching and digging a little deeper. I also plan on checking  out Pawlikowski's previous film, [Ida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELIMeemx-FI).
