The book follows the author as he travels the world collecting components for his dream bike. I loved the tone and the fluid structure, which moved between personal stories, history lessons, and practical information.

I finished the book more enthused than ever about biking and also had a much better understanding of how the bike came to be what it is today.

This was the first book in The Bandits book club and Nathan, Josh, Paul, and I were able to get together to chat about the book and geek out about custom bikes over Zoom.
