A fun, not too serious romp around London with mods on Vespas as they get in scuffles with rockers and listen to The Who. The movie had a resurgence in the late 90's when I was in high school and Britpop was gaining popularity. I was into Britpop, but I never did get around to watching this movie. I even remember seeing the [poster](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eumkCJ%2B3L._AC_.jpg) hung up on my friend's wall.

If I had seen this movie then, in my teens, I would have have absolutely gone to the army-surplus store in town to find an oversize parka and made plans to someday get a Vespa. But this is one of those movies that has to be watched at a time when you're compeltely ready to embrace its attitude and culture, for me, this isn't the time.
