Weird, messy, and like nothing I've seen before. _The Lure_ is a Polish horror/comedy/musical/fairy tale genre-hopper about two young mermaids coming of age in a cruel male world. It's stylish and beautifully constructed, with vivid colors and sound, interspersed with some grissly horror bits. The plot was never rivettng, nor was I ever invested in any of the characters, so the experience felt shallow, but I'm happy to have watched all the weirdness.
