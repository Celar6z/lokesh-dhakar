If you can only watch one Western, this is it. Ennio Morricone's score is incredible. Eli Wallach (The Ugly) is a blast to watch. Clint Eastwood (The Good) plays the mysterious poncho-wearing, cowboy anti-hero with ease. The plot does fumble around a bit, but it really only serves to put our characters into interesting situations so we can see how it plays out. And it all comes together with the infamous [final duel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJCSNIl2Pls), which I absolutely love.

This is close to five-star movie for me. The things holding it back is the pacing, which is a little slow at times, and the awful overdubbing and sound effects which can be distracting.
