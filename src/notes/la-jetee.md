A short sci-fi film from the 1960s that's worth a watch for a couple of reasons. First, it's the movie that inspired 12 Monkeys, which was was one of my favorite movies growing up and led me into Terry Gilliam's back catalog. Second, and more importantly, is the unorthodox format. The movie is made up almost entirely of still photos; with a single narrator providing limited voice-over. This format brings it's own pace and poetry. There is time to sit on an image, and time to fill in the gaps with your imagination. 

The movie isn't perfect. I found the plot to be intriguing, but incomplete. But kudos to Chris Marker for experimenting with the format.
