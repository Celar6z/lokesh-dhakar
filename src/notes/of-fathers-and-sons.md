This was eye-opening.

The documentary captures the lives of a Jihadist family in Syria over the span of two years. You witness the children's early radicalization and desentization to violence, and even get to to see their routine at the militant training camps. The access the director was able to get under the guise of a sympathetic photojournalist is really astounding.

It's shot in a fly-on-the-wall style. So no narration, a slow pace, and intimate, often-labored shots. The framing isn't sympathetic to their ideology, but it does give you time to see the subjects as people. We are all human beings after all.
