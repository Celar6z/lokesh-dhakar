Simply written and a little disjointed, but ends on a warm and moving note that makes the lead up worthwhile. There are no big surprises in this journey, but Alex's sincerity and authenticity makes it worth it. 

A little aside on self-improvement. Auto-biographies might be the best self-improvement books. 

The lessons and advice are usually simple, and that is the case in this book, but what they say is less important than how it resonates with you. Does it cause a change in your behavior? To have it make a last impact, it helps to have the person providing this guidnace be someone who has gained your trust. Reading a short blog post with a bullet list of life-hacks is unlikely to have that level of impact.
