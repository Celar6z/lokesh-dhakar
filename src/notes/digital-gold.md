A well-written and entertaining, non-technical history of Bitcoin. Though I was familiar with many of the people and events (the cypherpunks, Ross Ulbright, Mt Gox, et al), the book helped me place them in time and connect the dots on how they related to the development of Bitcoin and its popularity. A strong first-effort from the New York Times tech reporter.
