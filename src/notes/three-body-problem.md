It didn't live up to the hype. The character development is nonexistant, there are long segments (the VR video game) that are a slog, and the resolution at the end is unsatisfying, and one I would describe as _deus ex machina_. 

What the book has going for it is a big novel concept around _first contact_, which I did enjoy, particularly the social and political questions that arise from it. The _hard science_ that others rave about didn't do much for me though.

I do wonder how much my enjoyment of the story was affected by the fact that I 'read' the book as an audiobook and my listening was disjointed, spread out over a couple of months. Unlikely I would have loved the book, but it does make me wonder.
