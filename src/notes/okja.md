I went into this mostly blind, expecting a live-action Miyazaki-esque movie. And in a way, it is a bit of fairy-tale, but it's also a comedy, action movie, satire, and social commentary. What's impressive is how all these tonally different pieces come together. The pacing and plotting are excellent. Bong Joon Ho is clearly a master of his craft.

I was also very happy to see animal rights and factory farming as subjects in a movie. Usually these topics are limited to low-budget documentaries and PETA videos. There is a little nod to Upton Sinclair's _The Jungle_ near the end that was a nice touch: "They use everything about the hog except the squeal."
