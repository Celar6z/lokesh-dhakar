It's an important album, often namechecked as an influence by other artists, and a piece of the foundation that the punk genre was built upon. I can appreciate it's place in history, but the album don't resonate with me.

What I do like is that Patti Smith doesn't hold back. Her singing is raw, fierce, and uniquely hers. Behind her voice, the music is more garage rock than punk. It's simple and stripped down, with John Cale (Velvet Underground) producing.

Those who laud this album, often note the messages and stories in the songs. This is something that isn't easily pulled out from the lyrics, which can be cryptic. I haven't had much luck myself. I'm learning, that when I listen to music, unless the lyrics are straightforward, they tend to blur into the instrumentation and I stop connecting the dots of the story, and just came back for the hooks.

Favorite tracks: [Land: Horses / Land of a Thousand Dances / La Mer(de)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSk6jfln84A)
