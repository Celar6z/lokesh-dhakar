A look at manufacturing challenges in the US; and there are plenty. The documentary highlights the impact of globalization and hints at the upcoming automation revolution. It never goes deep, with either the personal stories or the industry analysis, but it is a great surface-level primer on the topics.

As with many other Netflix produced docs I've watched, I found it overly polished. The editing often feels suspect as events and reactions line up perfectly for dramatic effect. My preference would have been for a more _Direct Cinema_ approach. This fly-on-the-wall approach often does a better job capturing the ambiguity and nuances of these complex situations, but you do risk muddling your narrative.
