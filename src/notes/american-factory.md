A look at manufacturing challenges in the US; and there are plenty. The documentary highlights the impact of globalization and hints at the upcoming automation revolution. It never goes deep, with either the personal stories or the industry analysis, but it is a great surface-level primer on the topics.

As with many other Netflix produced documentaries, I found it a little too polished at times. The editing often feels suspect as events and reactions line up perfectly for dramatic effect. When viewing critically, this can raise some doubts about the content.
