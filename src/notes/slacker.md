The classic Gen-X indie film from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Linklater">Richard Linklater</a>.

The movie has no main character. Instead, it has a meandering camera that uses long takes to move between characters and stories, mostly unrelated. It's a movie about conversations and small moments, and not about plot. The unconventional structure is refreshing.

The people, the conversations, everything, it all felt familiar. I lived in this world in the early 2000s in Boston, even though this movie takes place in Austin at the start of the 90s.

Though the term _slacker_ has negative connotations now, Linklater thought of slackers in positive terms. Something akin to a hippie or a beatnik. <i>These are people who intentionally disconnect from mainstream society, not because they are apathetic or unmotivated, but because society isn't helping them, and they don't see what it offers.</i>

_"Slacker is inspiration to keep on with those passion projectsâ€”to go your own way despite the pressure to conform. Above all, the film taught me this: Those who wander may not be lost." - Eleanor Capaldi_

Recommended for those who say "film" rather than "movie". You know who you are. You probably enjoy other 'films' like [Breathless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHQ2Q-_bl8k) and [Buffalo 66](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5FzzN20-60).
