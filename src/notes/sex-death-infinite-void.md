This is a fine rock album, but this batch of Britpop songs are just not memorable. The bar for a verse, loud chorus, verse, loud chorus song is much higher for me these days. The album is full of polished songs and decent hooks, but everything sounds derivative of the Bitpop/Alt-rock of the late 90s.

A track that exemplifies their sound is [Annabelle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6dORf4EVMc&ab_channel=Creeper). My favorite track is the slightly goth [Posioned Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbgQV4ME174).
