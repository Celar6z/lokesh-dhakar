I binged it. I knew it wasn't good for me, but it was hard to stop watching the insanity unfold.

If you haven't seen it yet, skip it. The show has serious issues. The directors, who sound like they originally had good intentions to raise awareness about big cat captivity issues, lost their way. They plotted and edited their way into trashy tv to get ratings. They had a great opportunity, and a captive audience, but sadly, more people are discussing Joe Exotic and trolling Carole Bakin, instead of considering the welfare of the animals. Joe Exotic has become a folk hero and most viewers have a distorted view of the situation.
