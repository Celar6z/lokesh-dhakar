Tampopo is an offbeat Japanese movie about a ramen shop that is structured like a _Western_, absurdist when it wants to be, and mouth-watering. The main story follows the namesake character, Tampopo, as she struggles to drum up business for her shop. Then one-by-one we get introduced to our band of outsiders â€“ strangers coming to to town to help a homesteader.

The main arc follows our posse as they work to develop the perfect ramen bowl. It's a fun watch and you will 100% crave noodles! Interspersed in the main arc are a set of vignettes that are a each a few minutes long. They have food themes, but the characters and plots are indpendent of the main arc. This is where the absurdist style comes in to play. It gets weird. Unforunately, these are hit or miss for me, and with more misses than hits. I commend the effort, as the movie wouldn't be as interesting or original if it was a straightfoward self-improvement story.

My two favorite scenes: [eating with the ramen master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WrkdTrrwew) and [ordering at the French restaurant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRVLqUpHDJE).
