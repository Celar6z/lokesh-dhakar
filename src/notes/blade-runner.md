When I first watched the movie, the visuals were what left a mark. Now after seeing _Blade Runnner 2049_ and reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F">_Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_</a>, I've come to appreciate the themes the movie explores. The plot is fine, but less remarkable.

Dark alleys lit with neon, endless rain, noir lighting, and technology that is futuristic but also worn and textured. All of these are now visual touchstones that every modern sci-fi film taps. The impact of Blade Runner on sci-fi imagery, especially cyberpunk, cannot be overstated. And the movie still looks great 30+ years later.

_What does it mean to be human?_ This is the overarching question in the movie. It plays out between humans and replicants. Replicants are 'robots' created by humans that are virtually identical to humans, but treated as property. Through out the movie, it's not clear if Deckard, Harrison Ford's character, is a replicant or not. This is an interesting way to point out that the answer to the question of Deckard's humanity doesn't matter. If as viewers, we can't tell if he is a replicant or not, does it matter if he is or not?
