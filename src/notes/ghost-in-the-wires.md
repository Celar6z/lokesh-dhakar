What starts out as an interesting story about Mitnick's adventures in hacking loses steam as it continues to repeat itself. Mitnick finds a system, social engineers his way in, guesses a password, maybe installs a backdoor, and then repeats. All the while, he constantly talks himself up, gloating about his exploits and how he has outwitted his captors. His ego also puts in to question some of the details of the events.

The book does pick in the last third as Mitnick has a few close calls while on the run. It's not a bad book and I enjoyed listening to it. But I wouldn't recommend it and don't plan on revisiting it.
