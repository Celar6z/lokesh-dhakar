Let me get my criticism out of the way, which is that there are a lot of ideas explored in the movie, and many didn't land cleanly for me. This made it feel muddled as I thought about what I had watched. To me, the movie worked better as a mood piece, then a statement piece.

But there is so much to love about this movie. Seeing SF from a different set of eyes was refreshing and welcome. In terms of the craft, the [opening scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oy_HiDFfVo) is an instant classic, the score and the re-envisioning of classic tunes is great, and the way it captures the SF cityscape is gorgeous and not like anything I've seen before. It is a very impressive debut film, and I'm excited to what Talbot and crew do next.
