_Bicycle Thieves_ (aka _The Bicyle Thief_ in the US) is a stark Italian Neorealist film that follows an everyman and his son over a couple of days as they hunt for their stolen bicycle. The plot is simple, but it's absolutely riveting, and you're invested in the characters from the start, rooting for them through each challenge. The movie reflects the attitudes of the time, which was Italy post-World War 2, so the tone is dire, but honest. The movie believes that reality is rich, and to look at it is enough, so don't expect any contrived happy-endings.

The character arc reminded me quite a bit of _The Jungle_, another favorite of mine. Both of these follow downtrodden characters and show that life isn't always fair, with bad things happening to good people, who in turn are put in siutations where their morality and integrity are put against their survival. Their crimes are often an act of despration in these impossible situations.
