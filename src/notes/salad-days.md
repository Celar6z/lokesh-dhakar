A look at the people and the city from which which sprung out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJFWirQ3ks">Fugazi</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thnb3UlH2zE">Bad Brains</a>, and many other influential hardcore/punk bands. And the record label in the middle of it all, Dischord Records, which is still kickin' to this day. Along the way we learn about the origin of the straight edge movement and emo(core), both of which I was familiar with, but not their roots. Fun documentary, but a little long, even for someone who likes the music.

Recommended for those who like punk rock and also like niche musical documentaries.
