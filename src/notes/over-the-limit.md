I like the no narration, fly-on-the-wall approach the documentary takes as it follows our protaganist, Russian gymnast Maragarita Mamun. We sit on the sidelines along with the coaches as she goes through a brutal training regimen ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics.

But the movie feels shallows. Mamun puts up a wall for most of the movie â€” rarely talking, except in a few scenes with her boyfriend. We're left to speculate about her feelings. Does she still enjoy the sport? Is the verbal abuse from the coaches getting to her? It's unclear and I wish the movie was able to capture her opening up a bit more, but alas, this is _direct cinema_.
