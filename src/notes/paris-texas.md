The movie starts with Travis appearing haggard, with a red baseball cap making his way alone through the desert in Southern Texas. The intro is slow and straightfoward, but compelling. It sets the pace and tone for the movie, and raises a bunch of questions that hook you in.

As the movie progresses, we slowly begin to fill in the gaps of Travis's backstory as he regroups with his brother and his son, and finally goes on a journey to reunite his son with his mother. You need to throw out any practical concerns and worries about loose ends, as the movie takes on more fable-like qualities. I was 100% bought in, and ready to follow Travis and his attempt to mend past wounds â€“ to make up for past trauma, inflicted on him and inflicted by him.

Though the movie is subtle, and the pace slow, I was mesmorized from start to finish. The characters and their actions are believable and well acted. And because of this, everything lands emotionally in a nuanced way. The characters are at the same time likable and sympathetic, but also frustrating. The ending is joyous, yet sad. The movie highlights the grayness in life.

The film also looks great. The appearance is very natural and the lighting used is completely invisible in the indoor shots. And the icing on the cake is the great slide guitar score by Ry Cooder.

Fun fact: This was Kurt Cobain's favorite movie.
