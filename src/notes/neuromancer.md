The book is a seminal work in the _cyberpunk_ genre. It solidified the genre and laid out the archetypes which still live on in current books and movies. Think hackers with implants and colored hair, navigating cyberspace (aka the "matrix" in the book) in virtual reality. But as important and influential as the book is, and with how many boxes it checks for me, I still didn't enjoy the reading experience.

The problem for me was the style of the prose. The writing is frenetic and jumpy. I found it challenging to follow the plot as we bounced from scene to scene. It didn't help that the world, as conceptually interesting as it is, wasn't fleshed out. And lastly, and this one isn't the fault of Gibson, is that I listened to it as an audiobook. This made going back to 're-read' sections to get clarification tedius.

I still love the genre and am excited to read more books that focus on the combination of "high tech, low life".
