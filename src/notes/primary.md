A documentary that follows John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey over a couple of day during the 1960 primary election. The reason I sought it out is that it's noted as one of the movies that helped developed the then nascent _[Direct Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Cinema)_ movement.

Direct Cinema is a type of documentary filmmaking where the subject is unaware of the camera and the filmmakers don't participate in the action. The filmmakers let the story play out and develop independently, rather than coming to the project with a narrative in mind or constructing one retroactively. There is something raw and honest about this process that makes this style of documentary very intimate.
