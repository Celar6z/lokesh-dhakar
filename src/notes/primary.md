A documentary that follows John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey over a couple of day during the 1960 primary election. The reason I sought it out is that it's noted as one of the movies that helped develop the then nascent _[Direct Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Cinema)_ movement. This is a type of documentary filmmaking where the filmmakers don't participate in the action, instead they let the story play out and develop independently, rather than coming to the project with a narrative in mind or constructing one retroactively. There is something raw and honest about this process that makes this style of documentary very intimate.

It's worth a watch. It's a nice time capsule of the period and an important milestone for documentary filmmaking. It's also just 53 minutes long.
