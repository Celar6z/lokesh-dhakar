Wes Anderson movies always have wonderful production design. But with the absolute control you get with stop motion animation, he is really on a different level here. I recommend clicking around the [10 min extended preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTfSg77jrJw) to see for yourself.

I do have two complaints. The acting is stilted and often stiff. This really goes for all Wes Anderson movies. And second, partly because of the first reason, the dogs don't _feel_ like dogs. They seem like human Wes Anderson characters voicing dogs.

These complaints could take down other movies. But they don't here. The movie is beautiful. The plot is playful. The music is incredible. All together, it's a super fun movie.

I do want to mention the discussion around cultural appropriation and the representation of Japanese in this movie. I didn't note any issues while watching the movie and read about the concerns after. Justin Chang's [review in the LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-isle-of-dogs-review-20180321-story.html) is worth a read. It's a nuanced issue and after reading some more, including interviews from Wes, I'm staying in the _cultural appreciation_, not _appropriaton_, camp.
