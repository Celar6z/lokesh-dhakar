This movie feels more relevant today than ever before. It doesn't flinch when tackling racial issues or police violence. It shows what simmers underneath, and what happens when the pot boils over.

There is a lot of discussion about the final scene, and whether Mookie "does the right thing" by destroying Sal's pizzeria. Two points:
1. <u>Love vs Hate</u>: You can attempt to resolve issues with peaceful protest (MLK) or violence in certain scenarios (Malcom X). In this case, Mookie yells "Hate" before throwing the trash can in to the pizzeria. Spike Lee spoke about this and said that at this time, and in this climate, this approach was necessary to bring on change.
2. <u>Police killing of Radio Raheem</u>: Raheem is killed a minute prior in the movie by a chokehold from the police. But suddenly, our concern has shifted to the destruction of Sal's pizzeria. A bit of this is how the movie carries you forward, but it also captures a lack of empathy we have for this black character. An uncomfortable, but important call-out.

I highly recommend watching the movie. It's topical and challenging. It's also masterfully crafted â€“ the energy, the heat, the uneasieness, and the build up of tension, all come through on screen through amazing camera work and acting.
