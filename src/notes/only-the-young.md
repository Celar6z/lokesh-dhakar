A loose, meandering documentary following three teenagers in a small Southern California town just being themselves and doing teenager things. It's simple, but genuine, and more affecting than I expected â€“ not from any big events that take place during the filming, but from seeing their youthful energy and attitude, and thinking about how I used to be that way at that age, and reflecting back on those simpler times with nostalgia.
