I enjoyed the book, but it took me quite a while to get into it and required me to let go of my criticisms. And I had many. The characters are mostly two-dimensional, the dialogue and inner-monologues are clunky, there is a lot of exposition, telling rather than showing, and the pace can be plodding. Do you remember those political scenes in the Star Wars prequels where characters stood around and talked about political factions and events in the galaxy and you scramble in your head to connect the dots, it's a lot of that.

So... why did I still enjoy the book? It was because of Herbert's incredible world-building. The planet of Arrakis, the ecosystem, the native people, the Bene Gesserit, all of it was fascinating. Herbert teased ideas about the world early, such as the mystery of how spice is created and what exists on other parts of the planet. All of this hooked me more than any concern about the fate of the characters.

The book does have some fun set pieces, and becomes a page turner by the end. But this wasn't enough to convince me to keep reading the series. I've heard mixed reviews about the follow-up books. I'll revisit this idea after I watch the movie.
