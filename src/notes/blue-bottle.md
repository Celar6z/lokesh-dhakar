I was hoping for a general education on coffee and the Blue Bottle story, and though both of those topics were covered, they were dryly written, and a good half of the book went into the weeds with technical brewing instructions and pastry recipes.

I'd recommend this book for serious home roasters and brewers, and not for the casual coffee drinker looking for a Bill Bryson-esque romp through the coffee industry.
