It's unclear who the audience for this movie is. Fans of the books will be disappointed by the changes, and those unfamiliar with the source material will be confused. There are still some funny moments to enjoy, but there are also many jokes that didn't translate well to the screen.

As for the plot, the movie plucks material from the first book, throws in a couple of new side adventures, adds a love story, and switches to a happy ending. It all feels cobbled together. The absurdity is preserved, but the undercurrent of sadness and nihilism is lost. 

<!--
  Arthur Dent - Human protagonist who we follow around the univserse. It's his house that is being bulldozed at the start.

  Ford Prefect - Friend of Arthur who brings him on the adventures by initially hitchhiking on a passing by Vogon ship before Earth is destroyed to make way for a bypass.

  Zaphod Beeblebrox - President of the galaxy. Steals Heart of Gold ship that has an improability drive. A little unclear how exactly the drive works, but it takes them around the universe.
