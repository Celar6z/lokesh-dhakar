This is an album that got heavy play in my bedroom growing up and it still holds up as an incredible glam rock album from start to finish. It's one of a select few albums where I never skip a track.

The Ziggy Stardust character and storyline is intriguing, but also hard to follow and somewhat thin. I like the album for the music, less the concept.

This was my intro to Bowie and it led me to check out Hunky Dory and eventually work from his Berlin Trilogy.

My favorite tracks are the bookends:
- [Five Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ObjtVdsV3I)
- [Rock 'n' Roll Suicide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOgVoxqKU7U)
