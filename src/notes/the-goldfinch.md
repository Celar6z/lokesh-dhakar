Wonderfully written. The language is beautiful and lush, and Donna Tartt manages to sustain it for over 700 pages. It's an impressive feat, and she is clearly a master of her craft. The subject matter is well-researched, and I love the small detours into the art world she takes us on, as well as her musing on philosophy and art.

The writing wasn't flawless though. I had issue with the pacing and tonal shifts. They might have been done for effect, but they left me enjoying certain sections of the book, New York, much more than others, Las Vegas.

I listened to the audiobook, which has excellent narration and was incredibly easy-to-follow. This is a perfect book to listen to.

> "If you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn't it? And isn't the whole point of things—beautiful things—that they connect you to some larger beauty? Those first images that crack your heart wide open and you spend the rest of your life chasing, or trying to recapture, in one way or another?”" - Donna Tartt
