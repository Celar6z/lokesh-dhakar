This is the first rogue-like I've played and I loved it! The Greek god theme, the  writing, and the voice-overs all combine to add a rich texture to this action game. Cherry on top is a beautifully told and illustrated ending.

The gameplay and all the mechanics are polished, but one thing still managed to stand out, which was how the game lays out incentives to play in different ways. How it encourages players to use different weapons, attacks, keepsakes, and boons to explore breadth of the game.
