This is another book I adored growing up. Does it hold up? Mostly.

_Snow Crash_ was my intro into the cyberpunk genre and it's on the very short list of books I've read more than twice. I love the world building; the sovereign zones run by big business franchises, the self-policing gated community 'burbclaves', the Second World-esque metaverse, and so much more. The set pieces are also fast-paced and a fun ride, especially the initially pizza delivery.

But there are a few things that don't hold up as well. Neal Stephenson does this thing where he info dumps on a topic, and these excursions span many, many pages. In this case, we get an education on Sumerian myths and language. The problem is that these segments break up the flow of the story and cause a huge tonal shift. I found these sections tedius. Another issue with the book is the character YT's age, 15. It's problematic in many scenes.

Overall, I did enjoy the book on this revisit. I'd like to read other Stephenson books that take place in this or a similar world.
