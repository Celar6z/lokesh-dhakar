I finally got around to listening to the album in it's entirety, and I approve of its pedestal placement. It's a fun listen from start to finish, and stays interesting, thanks to all the genre hopping, from punk, to reggae, to dub, to rockabilly, and more. Some of the political messages were of a specific time and place, so don't resonate, but the music still hits.

My favorite tracks:
