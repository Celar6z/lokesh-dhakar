Not necessarily a bad documentary, but one that plays it safe in it's structure and doesn't go deep into any one topic. And for someone who is familiar with Shepard Fairey and his work, the doc doesn't uncover much new, besides a few behind-the-scenes clips of him working in the studio and the streets, which, were the highlights for me.
