Going to the moon and back is an astonishing feat and doesn't need any embellishing to inspire awe. There are no talking heads or recreations in this documentary. What you get is 90 minutes of archival footage and audio, tactfully put together.

The restored 70mm NASA footage is gorgeous and worth the price of admission. The score is stellar too. 

I finished this movie marvelling at the accomplishment, and inspired to take on more ambitious challenges myself.
