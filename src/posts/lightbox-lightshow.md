Lightshow JS script is still in the works, just taking a bit longer then expected.  It is similar to the Lightbox JS script with a few bonus features helpful for viewing photos in 'sets.' More details to come. For now I'd recommend you browse the recent comments and take a look at others who have extended the script with 'gallery' functionality.

Question: Anyone have an idea why my RSS feed appears 'broken' at the moment? I'm using Wordpress 1.5. hmm...
