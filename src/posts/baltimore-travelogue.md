<h2 class="subtitle">Places that are memorable for one reason or another.</h2>

It was made this year, though it collects a few places I've visited on trips to Baltimore in the past three years. *It's a log*: a list of places I want to remember and maybe revisit. *And a map*: showing me where things are relative to each other. It's not for driving directions. There is a 'to-do' list in the left column, which I've discontinued using.

It's big and I can hang it on my wall, which I can't to do with a Google Map or Yelp. See it full-size on [flickr][1].
