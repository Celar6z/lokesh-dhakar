This city is just about what I expected. It's a bit like Manchester, but not quite as friendly. My new place is nice though. It's roomy.

<del>I'm picking out a new camera this week.</del> I picked out a camera: the [Canon Digital Rebel XT](http://reviews.cnet.com/Canon_Digital_Rebel_XT_-_Black_Body_EF-S_18-55MM_Lens/4505-6501_7-31309327.html)! My old digital camera was pilfered when our place in Boston was broken into. I still have my old Canon EOS Rebel 35mm and an old Kodak Polariod camera , but you know the story with film processing/printing these days. $$$

Anyways, expect lots of Worcester photos shortly. The camera is on its way.
