## Side-by-side diagrams of a few common espresso drinks ##

I'm new to the world of fancy coffee drinks. With the vast number of ordering options and new words with accented characters to pronounce the coffee shop ordering experience can be intimidating. I've created a few small illustrations to help myself and others wrap their head around some of the small differences.

### About espresso ###
Espresso is prepared by forcing pressurized steam through finely ground dark-roast coffee beans. Think of it is strong, concentrated coffee. You can add extra 'shots' of espresso to make your drink stronger.

### About the diagrams ###
I gathered most of my information from [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) and tidbits from other online sources. Know that drinks might be prepared a bit differently coffee shop to coffee shop, and especially country to country.
