<div class="notice">
  Update: Both bikes have been claimed
</div>

Hey friends. I have a couple of older bikes that I'm not using anymore, if anyone wants either of these bikes, they are free for the taking. Bike #1 on the left is a Raleigh Racer and Bike #2 on the right is a Free Spirit. These bikes are both a bit on the heavy side and some tuning would help, but you can ride them around town just as they are, no problems.

Note: They currently reside in Manchester, NH and will not fit in my car. So either you would have to pick up, ride out, or wait till I get a bike rack.
