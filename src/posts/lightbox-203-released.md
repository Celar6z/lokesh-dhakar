<h2 class="post-subtitle">A minor update with a couple of bug fixes, a handful of tweaks, and some small niceties added.</h2>

After much delay comes the new update. I'm not extending the functionality at this point but making some tweaks and fixing some of the small bugs. You can grab it from the main page: [Lightbox JS v2.03][1]

*   Object and Embed elements hidden on Lightbox activation, prevents Flash movies and other media from appearing *through* Lightbox image
*   extended keyboard support (arrow keys, esc key)
*   added toggle in Javascript file to turn off animations
*   imagemap support
*   valid CSS
*   clicking anywhere in 'shadow' closes Lightbox
*   removeDuplicates function works with incontiguous items
*   a bit of code cleanup

Like I said, minor stuff.
