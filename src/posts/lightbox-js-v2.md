## <a href="http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lightbox JS v2.0</a> - Go check it out!

Use the comments on this entry to post and discuss bugs, questions, and troubleshoot the script. I'll be in and out of here.

**3/31/06**: I've Released a minor update <a href="http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/#download">v2.01</a> that fixes IE6 centering and smooths out the kinks in the resize transition. If you're looking for multi-line captions or keyboard navigation, expect another minor update this weekend.

**4/4/06**: New update <a href="http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/#download">v2.02</a> that keeps the layout in check when captions extend to multiple lines. Keyboard navigation has also been enabled. Lastly, the addition of a variable in the lightbox.js configuration section to control the speed of the resize transitions.
