I took a drive up to New Hampshire for the [Deerfield Fair][1] with two of my roommates. The rain came down and messed things up a bit. We still had a blast eating fried dough and watching the horse pull competition. Picture of Sierra and Dylan on a hill overlooking the gazillion cars that were in the lot:
