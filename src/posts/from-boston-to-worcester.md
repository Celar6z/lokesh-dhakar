I've picked up a proper full-time job after almost a year of freelancing. I'll be taking on the role of 'Web Developer' at 3000k, a web design shop in Worcester. I can't fathom two plus hours of commuting time daily so I will be moving to Worcester at the end of the month. I hope to spend as many weekends as I can back in Boston on couches and in sleeping bags, so no worries.

Besides that, I'm backlogged on just about everything right now, including a site overhaul. Once I get a few hours to spare I'll make this site disappear and reappear.
