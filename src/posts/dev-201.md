Welcome to another article in the _Dev_ series, where I attempt to explain and recreate interesting front-end dev techiniques I run across on the web.

We're going back to Stripe.com again for this article. This time we'll do something interactive. Let's see if we can recreate the main navigation (see movie above) from [Stripe .com](https://stripe.com/).

Let's start by tackling what is probably going to be the hardest part of the exercise, animating the box while simultaneously switching the content.

## Part 1: Animating the box

### Using width and height transitions

One way to animate the box would be to use CSS transitions to smoothly move between `width`, `height`, and `left` values. In the live example below, we're toggling the `.next` class on and off the box every second.

<pre><code class="prism language-css line-numbers">.box {
  left: 20px;
  width: 390px;
  height: 240px;
  transition: all 0.4s;
}

.box.next {
  left: 140px;
  width: 240px;
  height: 180px;
}</code></pre>

<p class="codepen" data-height="360" data-theme-id="35671" data-default-tab="result" data-user="lokesh" data-slug-hash="Lqyadj" data-pen-title="Stripe - Main Navigation 1.0 - Animating width and height">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

**Beware of jank.** This looks like what we want on the surface. But there is one problem. We're making the browser do extra work on the main thread, and this puts us at risk of creating slowdown in our animation and having the browser drop below 60fps and feel sluggish.

So what's the culprit? Animating `width`, `height`, or any of the position values, like `top` or `left`, forces the browser to run it's _Recalculate Style_ process, and this CPU-expensive process needs to run on every frame where the value changes.

Thankfully, there is a more performant way to do this animation...

### Using transforms

The rule of thumb for creating performant animations on the web is to use the `transform` and `opacity` CSS properties. The browser is able to animate both of these properties cheaply. It does this by offloading the work from the main thread to the GPU. We'll see what this looks like later.

Let's look at `transform` a little closer. It's particularly handy as it can replace multiple other CSS properties that are less performant in animations:

<pre><code class="prism language-js line-numbers">width  -> transform: scaleX()
height -> transform: scaleY()
top    -> transform: translateY()
left   -> transform: translateX()
</code></pre>

Let's update our previous demo to use `transform`:

<pre><code class="prism language-css line-numbers">.box {
  width: 390px;
  height: 240px;
  transform-origin: 0 0;
  transition: transform 0.4s;
}

.box.next {
  transform:
    translateX(120px)
    scaleX(calc(240 / 390))  /* scaleX(0.61) */
    scaleY(calc(180 / 240)); /* scaleY(0.75) */
}</code></pre>


It's a little more math, but not too scary. The `scaleX()` and `scaleY()` functions take a number that represents the scaling factor from the original value. So if the width of an element is `200px` and you want to scale it to be `300px`, you would use `transform: scaleX(1.5)`.

It's important to note that changing the `scale` is not the exact same thing as changing the `width` and the `height` as it affects the element's content. We'll come back to this later.

<p class="codepen" data-height="360" data-theme-id="35671" data-default-tab="result" data-user="lokesh" data-slug-hash="mvOEzJ" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Stripe - Main Navigation 1.1 - Using transforms">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

**Was the refactor worth it?** We can open Chrome Devtools and do a _performance audit_ to see how the two versions compare.

Here is a frame from our first version where we were animating the `width` and `height` properties:

<div class="figure max-width">
  <img src="/media/posts/dev/201/frame-width-animated.png" alt="Source code snippet for how to use Stripe Terminal in card that is tilted and floating with shadow.">
</div>

Note the  _Recalcalculate Style_ process in the activity list and the other cascading processes it triggered. Now let's look at a frame from our updated version with the `transform` property being animated:

<div class="figure max-width">
  <img src="/media/posts/dev/201/frame-transform-animated.png" alt="Source code snippet for how to use Stripe Terminal in card that is tilted and floating with shadow.">
</div>

Zero work on the main thread. 👌

## Part 2: Adding the content

### Scaling issues

We had mentioned that adding a _scale transform_ isn't exactly the same as changing the _width_. This is because all the child elements also get scaled. Let's add content to the box and see what this behavior looks like:

<p class="codepen" data-height="400" data-theme-id="35671" data-default-tab="result" data-user="lokesh" data-slug-hash="pGPBLP" data-pen-title="Stripe - Main Navigation 2.0 - Scaling content">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/lokesh/pen/pGPBLP/">
  Stripe - Main Navigation 2.0 - Scaling content</a> by Lokesh Dhakar (<a href="https://codepen.io/lokesh">@lokesh</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

That's not going to work. Though we did get the performance win with the switch to _transforms_, we are going to have to rework out HTML structure.

### Redoing the markup


1. **Making the content a sibling of the box element**

Previously:

```
<div class="box"> <!-- scale transform -->
  Content in here
</div>

Updated structure:

<div class="popover">
  <div class="content">Content in here</div>
  <div class="background"></div> <!-- scale transform -->
</div>
```
Now the scale transform applied on the background element will not affect the content. Both the
content and background elements have been absolutely positioned and have the same dimensions. So
they are layered and fit together.

2. **Adding the different navs to the content div**
```
 <div class="content">
    <div class="section section-products active">
      ...
    </div>
    <div class="section section-developer">
      ...
    </div>
    <div class="section section-company">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
```

We're absolutely positioning each of the different navs. This will allow us to do a cross-fade. I've
made all the navs visible so you can see their positioning:

<p class="codepen" data-height="400" data-theme-id="35671" data-default-tab="result" data-user="lokesh" data-slug-hash="pGPBGr"  data-pen-title="Stripe - Main Navigation 2.1 - Content markup">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>


## Part 3: Animating between content

### Cross-fading the content

We'll use the active class to show and hide the different navs. We're toggling the opacity from 0 to

<p class="codepen" data-height="400" data-theme-id="35671" data-default-tab="result" data-user="lokesh" data-slug-hash="qgjmKB" data-pen-title="Stripe - Main Navigation 2.2 - Cross-fade content">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

### Animating and positioning the background box

<p class="codepen" data-height="430" data-theme-id="35671" data-default-tab="result" data-user="lokesh" data-slug-hash="JxJNaP" data-pen-title="Stripe - Main Navigation 2.3 - Resizing the box">

</p>


## Part 4: Adding the top nav bar

The popover is now triggered by the nav bar. Mouse over and between them to check it out!

<p class="codepen" data-height="480" data-theme-id="35671" data-default-tab="result" data-user="lokesh" data-slug-hash="WPOOvg" data-pen-title="Stripe - Main Navigation 4.0 - Add nav bar">

</p>


## Part 5: Final UI touches

5.0 Add 3d swing open
<p class="codepen" data-height="480" data-theme-id="35671" data-default-tab="result" data-user="lokesh" data-slug-hash="ZwaRMJ" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Stripe - Main Navigation 5.0 - 3d open">

</p>

5.1 Add arrow
